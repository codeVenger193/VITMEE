# VIT MCA Previous year questions
Hi,
This respository is to help VITMEE MCA candidates. When I gave VITMEE back in 2018, there was no resource to see what type of questions does VIT asks. It's 2022 and the condition is still same.
On my youtube channel- Codevenger, I created few VIT MCA videos after which I got lot of messages from students who scored well in the test. Same students helped me to create this resource.

# VITMEE 2022, MCA

## Bharti, Rank 132
In my set, there were 20 questions of English, around 8-10 of maths and the rest were on computer.
For the English section, the questions were very very easy. There was very basic grammar. Some of the questions around 4-5 were not even from grammar like the questions I remember are-->
1. What is the name of a graph which shows data in the form of pictures?
2. What does the first line of the Memos state?
3. What we shouldn't do after writing a document? In this question one of the option is literally "tear that document and start writing a new one"
Maths questions were from Probability, P&C, mode of data. And these were very basic that can be made from the basic formula.
Now for the Computer, around 6-8 questions were from basic coding. For example,
1. a short code with If Else statement. We need to tell the output.
2. short code using "for statement" and tell output.
3. In 2 questions, maybe of "for statement" the answer was resulting in error.
4. One was from while loop also.
Other questions were mostly theoretical ones. For eg:
1. Name the data structure used to print fibonacci series.
2. Name the data structure used to print factorials of a number.
3. Choose the best case for the time complexity in quicksort, binary sort, merge sort etc.
4. There were 3-4 questions directly on Big O notation, time complexity but they were very easy.
5. Asked that which protocol is not an application layer protocol.
6. Similarly, which is a transport layer protocol?
7. 4-5 questions were directly from protocols and layers.
8. What is not done in normalisation?
9. There were 5-6 questions from relational schema.
10. Some questions were from conceptual, physical and internal level.
11. 3-4 Direct questions from Binary tree and graphs.
12. IP address format and its layer in OSI.
13. There was a question from K shell also.
14. Name the queue used by a medium level scheduler.
15. Definition of Throughput, Response time.
Overall, the exam was very easy but one thing that I didn't expect was that there were 4 theoretical questions from JAVA specifically asked about java system calls.
Also in my set there was not a single question from Pointers, malloc, calloc, linked lists, prefix or postfix expressions.

Q. Question related to semaphore                                      
Q. Code question where in switch case break wasn't used, so we need to tell till where would the code print if case is executed.                          
Q. One question on storage types in C- auto, extern etc.

Q. What kind of language should we use when writing technical instructions.                               
Q. Fill in the blanks.                            

## Chirag, Rank 45
I'll try to recall as much as I can...
This time I think there were more qtns from COA specially from flip flops (atleast 4).
There were couple of C programs which were tricky.
4 questions from physical layer.
In DBMS there were qtns regarding your knowledge in keys and Normalization.
Time complexity questions regarding couple of c programs given.
One can expect questions from scheduling algorithms topics but the question will not be directly regarding any numerical. Instead it would be a small numerical which can be solved in a min.
There can be some questions which are not included in the syllabus specifically but could be asked. Specially regarding hardware.
Studying all layers in CN is must. Probably the most important topic in the exam to be expected.

## Vyom, Rank 34
20 questions from English
DSA -> basic theory-based question
->LinkedList and array
->Binary Search
-> Time Complexity
C -> I/O questions, memory management
OS-> scheduling algorithm
DBMS-> only basic theory (No SQL queries)
CN-> layers and IP, MAC addresses.
COA-> left/right shift, ALU, pipelines
Maths-> 2 probability questions, 1 basic quad equation and 1 differentation.

## Raghav
25 question from english - easy level
from remaining 75 around 4-5 questions were from maths from topics like - probability, p and c, binomial, stats
remaing all questions were from computer
around 6-8 questions were code based where you had tell output
some numericals from computer networks
in my set majority theory questions were from dsa algo

## Govind
Active Passive Voice
Newton raphson method
IP address
Sorting Algorithms - 5-6 question
Register
Time complexity
Big O
Dbms-attribute related
ISI Model se ek question
C ka Code ka output
Stack queue se related ques
Network Protocols
Baud Rate
FIFO ANF LIFO
Arithmetic Operator Precedance
Probability

## Sakshi, Rank 244
The test level is moderate there were the basics of computer and personally in my paper there were 5-6 questions for maths of probability, matrices and complex number and and if you study for 10 days before exam you can clear it. I just study for 10 days and the result is here. Just focus on basics of computer and just see the English topics once ie. Minutes and memos

## Vaibhav,
Mostly the questions are from core subjects Like networking, computer organization, operating system and stuff very few maths questions only 2-3 questions were from maths. I don't rememer the questions exactly but the most questions were from operating system and organization but the questions was a bit difficult in depth.

## Ullas,
From what I remember matrix 2-3 questions I got. Most of the questions are from c such as find the error in the below code or find the output etc Then computer network, scheduling algo are important. Maths I just guessed and wrote and English was way too easy.

## Sagar,
computer awareness thoda jaada tha 20 english jo easy tha. math thoda difficult ho sakata hai but koi fark nhi padega kui ki no of question 5 se 6 hi hoga
